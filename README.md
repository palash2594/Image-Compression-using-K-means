# Image-Compression-using-K-means

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization it aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. In this project K-means clustering algorithm is used to find clusters among pixels in a given image. As we know every pixel in an image is made up of RBG color scheme, so by treating every pixel or point as a 3D point,'n' number of clusters can be found.

Implementation is done in python using Scikit-learn ML library.
